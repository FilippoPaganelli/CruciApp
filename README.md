# CruciApp

### This is a Flutter project for a crossword cross-platform app.

At the moment the HomePage just renders a list of tiles, each showing information about a crossword (its number, title, description, language and soon its dimensions).
Here's a snapshot of the current working prototype:

There's also a side menu with basic links (to the [browser version](https://filippopaganelli.github.io/crosswords.html), to this repository, to [my website](https://filippopaganelli.github.io/) and e-mail).
Here's a snapshot of the HomePage with the menu open:
